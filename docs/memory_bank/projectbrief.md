# Project Brief: Rate-Limited API Key Manager

## Project Mission

Build a production-ready, scalable API key management system with sophisticated rate limiting capabilities that can handle millions of requests while maintaining sub-millisecond response times for rate limit checks.

## Problem Statement

Modern API services need robust rate limiting to:
- Prevent abuse and ensure fair usage
- Implement tiered service offerings (free, pro, enterprise)
- Track usage for billing purposes
- Maintain service stability under high load
- Provide real-time usage analytics

## Target Users

### Primary Users
1. **API Service Providers**
   - Companies offering API-based services
   - SaaS platforms with API access
   - Internal microservice architectures

2. **Developers**
   - External developers consuming APIs
   - Internal teams building on the platform
   - DevOps teams monitoring usage

3. **Business Stakeholders**
   - Product managers tracking API adoption
   - Finance teams handling billing
   - Customer success monitoring usage patterns

## Key Goals

### Technical Goals
- Sub-millisecond rate limit checks
- Support for millions of concurrent API keys
- 99.99% uptime SLA
- Horizontal scalability
- Real-time usage tracking

### Business Goals
- Enable tiered pricing models
- Automated billing and overage handling
- Usage analytics and insights
- Self-service key management
- Compliance with rate limit policies

## Success Metrics

### Performance Metrics
- Rate limit check latency < 1ms (p99)
- System throughput > 100k requests/second
- Redis cache hit rate > 99%
- Database query time < 10ms (p95)

### Business Metrics
- API key creation time < 100ms
- Usage data accuracy > 99.9%
- Billing calculation accuracy = 100%
- Alert delivery time < 30 seconds

### Reliability Metrics
- System uptime > 99.99%
- Zero data loss for usage tracking
- Recovery time < 1 minute
- Backup frequency: hourly

## Core Features

### API Key Management
- Create, read, update, delete operations
- Key rotation for security
- Metadata association (name, tier, limits)
- Status management (active, suspended, revoked)

### Rate Limiting
- Sliding window algorithm
- Per-key custom limits
- Multiple time windows (second, minute, hour)
- Distributed rate limiting with Redis

### Usage Tracking
- Real-time request counting
- Historical usage data
- Endpoint-level granularity
- Response time tracking

### Billing Integration
- Automated usage calculation
- Overage detection
- Period-based billing records
- Integration with payment systems

### Monitoring & Alerts
- Usage threshold alerts
- Rate limit approaching notifications
- System health monitoring
- Custom alert configurations

## Constraints & Requirements

### Technical Constraints
- Must use Go for core services
- PostgreSQL for persistent storage
- Redis for rate limiting cache
- RabbitMQ for async processing
- Docker for containerization

### Security Requirements
- API keys stored as hashes
- TLS encryption for all communications
- Role-based access control
- Audit logging for all operations

### Compliance Requirements
- GDPR compliance for usage data
- SOC 2 compliance ready
- Data retention policies
- Right to deletion support
