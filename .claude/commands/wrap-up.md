Let's wrap up this session.

1. Make sure our taskmaster list is up to date with the current state of the project.

2. If any discoveries were made during the session that require work or diverting from our current plan, make sure to update the taskmaster list by adding new tasks or inserting new subtasks.

3. Update all the memory bank files in ./docs/memory_bank with any new information gathered during the session and ensure there is a clear path forward for the next session.
