## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

### ADR-001: Rate Limiting Algorithm Selection
**Date**: 2025-07-12  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Decision**: Use sliding window algorithm with Redis sorted sets  
**Rationale**: 
- More accurate than fixed windows
- Efficient Redis implementation
- Supports burst handling
- Sub-millisecond performance

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Token bucket: More complex implementation
- Fixed window: Less accurate for rate limiting
- Leaky bucket: Higher memory overhead

### ADR-002: Database Partitioning Strategy
**Date**: 2025-07-12  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Decision**: Monthly partitioning for usage_logs table  
**Rationale**:
- Balances partition size and management overhead
- Aligns with billing cycles
- Supports efficient time-range queries

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Daily partitioning: Too many partitions to manage
- Yearly partitioning: Partitions too large for performance

### ADR-003: Redis Sharding Approach
**Date**: 2025-07-12  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Decision**: Consistent hashing with client-side sharding  
**Rationale**:
- Simpler than Redis Cluster mode
- Better control over shard distribution
- Easier monitoring and debugging

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Redis Cluster: More complex setup and monitoring
- Single instance: Doesn't scale for high throughput

## Lessons Learned

### Design Phase
- **Comprehensive planning pays off**: Detailed architecture prevents later rework
- **Consider scalability early**: Sharding and partitioning decisions impact entire system
- **Document decisions**: ADRs help maintain context and rationale

### Future Considerations
- Performance testing should start early in development
- Security review at each phase milestone
- Regular architecture review sessions
- Continuous monitoring setup from day one
